Once your claim is approved, you'll receive regular payments for your coverage period (3, 6, or 9 months based on your plan) to help cover expenses while you search for a new position.",
    "question2": "Who is eligible for Income Shield coverage?",
    "answer2": "Income Shield is available to full-time technology professionals employed for at least 6 months at their current company. Coverage is available for software engineers, product managers, designers, data scientists, and other tech roles.",
    "question3": "How much does coverage cost?",
    "answer3": "Premiums vary based on your current salary, role, location, and selected coverage period. Use our premium calculator to get a personalized quote based on your specific situation.",
